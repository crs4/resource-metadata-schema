# Released
Status: This release is in complaint with DCAT2 based around **five main classes** as the core classes for all EJPRD VP resources [Figure 1](https://github.com/ejp-rd-vp/resource-metadata-schema/blob/dev-branch/ejprd-vp_catalog_model/versions/ejprdVPMetadataSchema-1.0.0/diagrams/VP_Model.png):

dcat:Catalog represents a catalog, which is a dataset in which each individual item is a metadata record describing some resource; the scope of dcat:Catalog is collections of metadata about datasets.

dcat:Resource represents a dataset, or other resource that may be described by a metadata record in a catalog. This class is not intended to be used directly, but is the parent class of dcat:Dataset and dcat:Catalog. Member items in a catalog should be members of one of the sub-classes, or of a sub-class of these, or of a sub-class of dcat:Resource defined in a DCAT profile or other DCAT application. dcat:Resource is effectively an extension point for defining a catalog of any kind of resource.

dcat:Dataset represents a dataset which is the collection of data, published or curated by a single organisation. Data comes in many forms including numbers, words, pixels, imagery, sound and other multi-media, and potentially other types, any of which might be collected into a dataset.

Organisation: government agencies or other entities that are responsible for the catalog publication and maintenance

Location: A spatial region or named place.
